# How Many Coins Do You Need
A program that outputs the least number of coins required to produce the value a user inputs. The program recieves the amount of money the user wants in the console, in cents, and prints the amount of quarters, dimes, nickles, and pennies the user will need to produce that amount.

This project is in Java. This project gave me experience with recieving user input, calculations in Java, and using Repl.it as an IDE.
